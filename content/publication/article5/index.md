abstract: This paper studies income distribution and inequality in Germany, Spain and Italy by adapting the approach described in Fana and Villani (2022a). This framework provides a novel classification of labourers and capitalists that considers some features of contemporary capitalism, namely the fact that individuals/households can receive multiple types of incomes, and the role of managers in the definition of class belonging. From this perspective, the paper addresses two objectives. First, we perform a
decomposition of the Gini index to study which sources of income contribute to the level of inequality. We find that marginal increases in wages would contribute to the reduction of the overall level of inequality, while profits and property income augment it. Furthermore, it is not that any type of wage would reduce inequality; only the growth of wages received by labourers would help to lower inequality, whereas those received by capitalists would increase it.
Second, we discuss how our approach links to the literature on wages at the top of the distribution of income, assessing whether the growth of wages at the top of the distribution of income is evident in our dataset and we explore who receives these wages at the top of the distribution of income. We find that there is a growing presence of wages at the top of the distribution of income. However, this growth corresponds mostly to wages received by what we call capitalists, not labourers.
To perform the empirical analysis, we build a novel dataset for three countries (Germany, Spain and Italy) using household finances surveys over the period 2000â€“2016.
Our findings contribute to the literature on labour income and top shares from an
innovative angle. We conclude that it is true that a linear correspondence between income source and class location is more blurred today than it was 200 years ago, nonetheless a class divide is still clear, at least in the three countries analysed.
