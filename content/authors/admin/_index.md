I am a PhD candidate in Social Sciences in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the Pompeu Fabra University. 

I combine economics and sociological literature to study the dynamics of labour markets, occupational structural changes, their impacts on income and wage inequalities, and intergenerational income and class mobility.
