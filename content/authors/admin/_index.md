I obtained my PhD in Social Sciences in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the Pompeu Fabra University, discussing the thesis "Key sources of income (and wage) inequalities: from the State to the individuals".

I combine economics and sociological literature to study the dynamics of labour markets, occupational structural changes, their impacts on income and wage inequalities, and intergenerational income and class mobility.

Currently, I am Post-Doctoral researcher at Roma Tre Univeristy, working on the Estate, Inheritance, and Gift Taxes section of the GC Wealth Project (https://wealthproject.gc.cuny.edu) and contribute to the activity of Inequality in Rome Research Group.
