I am part of the 'Abilities & Intergenerational Mobility' project headed by Prof. Esping-Andersen and funded by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Spain. 

The research aim is to better highlight transmission mechanisms of class advantage to children's destination outcome - being income or class position. Educational attainment is the traditional investigated channel in the famous O(rigin)-E(ducation)-D(estination) triangle. However, the interplay between social background and cognitive skills formation is another relevant mechanism.

In this sense, the project aims to identify whether cognitive skills and educational attainment may fully compensate the class effect, and/or the class advantage is still at play via 'glass-floor' (low-skilled individuals with privileged background fail to downgrade - both in class or income) or 'glass-ceiling' effects (significant gap between similar individuals with opposite origin background).
