Prof. Salvatore Morelli leads the GC Wealth Project, a central project of the Graduate Center's Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality, is a multi-year effort aimed at expanding and consolidating access to the most up-to-date research and information on wealth, wealth inequalities, and wealth transfers and related tax policies, across countries and over time.

The GC Wealth Project website — first launched in June 2023 — is organized around two main components: a data warehouse of gathered and novel data that can be visualized in a variety of ways through the interactive dashboard, and a Digital Library of Research on Wealth Inequality. Both are designed to provide researchers, policymakers, journalists, and others interested in wealth and wealth taxation with open, unlimited access to an array of high-quality information and resources.

All of the data, including the tailored visualizations that users can create using the interactive dashboard, can be exported.

As member of the Inequality in Rome Research Group and post-doctoral fellow, I concentrate on the Estate, Inheritance, and Gift taxation section of the GC Wealth Project. Together with my colleagues, we aim to improve the quality and coverage of EIG tax data across countries and over time, to facilitate empirical academic research.
