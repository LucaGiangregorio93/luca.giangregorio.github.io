I worked as an external consultant for the <a href= https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-research/centre-advanced-studies/digclass_en> 'Social Class in the Digital Age' </a> project developed by the Joint Research Center of Seville. 

Using different longitudinal micro-data sources for three European countries (Italy, Spain and Germany), we have created a homogenous, cross-sectional and longitudinal dataset with both individual and households units. This dataset cointains a rich set of socio-demographic information, labour market characteristics, income and wealth sources. 

This new dataset allow us to study how the labour and capital shares evolve once we refine the class scheme. Furthermore, we link the evolution of top-incomes inequality to the individual class position: class (re)definition is necessary to clearly understand the dynamics of income inequality, especially at the top.
