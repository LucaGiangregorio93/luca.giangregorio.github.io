VisitINPS research fellowship (type B) with Marta Fana and Michele Raitano on "The impact of domestic outsourcing on wages along the productive structure: evidence from Italian Administrative data".
Exploiting the matched employer-employee administrative data, we investigate the effects of domestic outsourcing strategy in Italy on wages, intensive, and extensive margin of Italian workers. 


Using similar data for Spain (Muestra Continua de Vida Laboral), we investigate whether the 2019 minimum wage increase have differential effects for outsourced vs in-house workers, its reallocation, spillover, employment, and redistributive effects.
