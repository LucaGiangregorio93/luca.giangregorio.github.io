Future projects aim to exploit the social security administrative data of Italy (provided by Italian Social Security Institute - INPS) and Spain (Muestra Continua de Vida Laboral) to investigate - over time - the outsourcing effects (i.e., contracting out) on wage inequality. Furthermore, in the case of Spain, it allows to decompose the direct and indirect effects of minimum wage on the overall wage inequality.
