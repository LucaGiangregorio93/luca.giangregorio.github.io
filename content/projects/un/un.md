Socio-economic inequalities in family behaviour and wellbeing: the role of economic security, role compatibility and gender relations. This project headed by Prof. Baizán Muñoz and Cortina Trilla, aims to investigate the role of socio-economic inequalities in explaining family dynamics. Furthermore, a second complementary question deals with the role of family dynamics in producing and
reproducing inequalities: There is mounting evidence that children’s life chances are influenced not only by income but especially by the parental nurturing and stimulus, with potential socially polarizing consequences.
